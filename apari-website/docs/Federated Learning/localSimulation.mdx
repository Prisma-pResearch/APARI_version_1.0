# Local simulation

With the environment of NVFlare and processed datasets, let's do some local simulation to get more ideas about Federated learning. 

## 1. Modify the configuration file
Refer to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Prisma-pResearch/APARI_Federated_Learning), you can find the configuration file for local simulation in `2_Local_Model_Validation`

There are two models provided:

* `icuStay` : This model is used to predict the length of stay in ICU.

* `mortality` : This model is used to predict the mortality of patients.

The client and server configuration files are placed under `eachModel/apari_scaffold/config/`
The model files are placed under `eachModel/apari_scaffold/custom/`

## 2. Run the simulation

```bash
## clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Prisma-pResearch/APARI_Federated_Learning

## create a workspace 
mkdir ./workspace_apari_local

## same operation for both models , simulate there are two sites
nvflare simulator -w ./workspace_apari_local -n 2 -t 2 ./APARI_Federated_Learning/2_Local_Model_Validation/icuStay/apari_scaffold

## for other operations, please check the official documentation or `nvflare simulator --help`

```

## 3. Check the results

The results will be located at ./workspace_apari_local/`<logFile>`
